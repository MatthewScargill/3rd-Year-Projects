# Third year projects
This is where I keep both projects I coded. 

The first is a very lacklustre simulation of the number of fusion reactions can take place given 2 quantities of reactants. 

The second is the infinitely more interesting boat building code, taking dimensions to craft a boat and fill it with an appropriate number of perfectly packaged oranges.
